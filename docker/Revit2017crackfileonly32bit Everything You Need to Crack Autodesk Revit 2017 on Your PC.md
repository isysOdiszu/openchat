# How to Download Revit 2017 File Only 32 Bit
 
If you are looking for a way to download Revit 2017 file only 32 bit, you might be disappointed to know that Autodesk has retired the 32 bit version of this product and it is no longer available[^1^]. This means that you cannot install Revit 2017 on a 32 bit operating system, and you will need to upgrade your hardware and/or software to meet the minimum system requirements for Revit 2017[^3^].
 
However, if you have a subscription to a current version of Autodesk software, you might be eligible to download some previous versions of Autodesk software as a benefit[^2^]. This includes Revit 2014, which was the last version that supported 32 bit operating systems. To download a previous version of Autodesk software, you will need to sign in to your Autodesk Account at manage.autodesk.com and find your product under All Products and Services. In the product tile, click the current version and select a previous version. Then you can download your product and use your serial number and product key to activate it[^2^].

Please note that downloading previous versions of Autodesk software is only available for flex users and customers with an active subscription. If you have an education license, you will need to go to the Education community to download previous versions. Also, please note that support, including technical support, software updates, and hotfixes, is only provided for previous releases up to three years back. This means that Revit 2014 is no longer supported by Autodesk and you might encounter some issues or limitations when using it[^2^].
 
We hope this article has helped you understand how to download Revit 2017 file only 32 bit. However, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your operating system and hardware to be able to use the latest version of Revit and enjoy its features and benefits.

## Why Upgrade to Revit 2017?
 
Revit 2017 is the latest version of Autodesk's building information modeling (BIM) software that offers many features and benefits for architects, engineers, contractors, and designers. Revit 2017 helps you create high-quality designs, improve collaboration, streamline workflows, and optimize performance. Here are some of the standout features from Revit 2017 that you might want to consider when upgrading:
  
### Improved View Refresh and Navigation Performance
 
One of the most noticeable improvements in Revit 2017 is the faster view refresh and navigation performance. This means that you can work more smoothly and efficiently with complex models and large datasets. You can also switch between different views and zoom in and out without lagging or freezing. This feature enhances your user experience and productivity when working with Revit 2017[^1^].
  
### Design to Fabrication Tool
 
Another useful feature in Revit 2017 is the design to fabrication tool that allows you to convert design level of detail (LOD) model elements to construction LOD elements. This means that you can easily generate fabrication-ready models from your design models without losing any information or accuracy. You can also use this tool to create detailed shop drawings and export them to various formats. This feature helps you bridge the gap between design and fabrication and improve coordination and efficiency[^1^].
